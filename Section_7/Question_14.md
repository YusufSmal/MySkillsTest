# Question 14

	OOP assists and enables easier collaborative development within teams, as this allows the project to be broken into smaller projects, focusing on creating smaller components, these small components can then be reused in other sections of the code, which prevents the developers from creating duplicate code.
	Most of the projects that I have worked on, have used the OOP approach, as the focus of development was around creating small sections of code, that would consume and manipulate data that is then saved or passed on to the next step in the software's flow. In my work at WorkStatz, even though the site was mostly created from a wireframe that was handed to me, I still approach each page as a separate project, creating all the necessary frontend code related to that page. Once the code for the frontend was done, I would then approach each pages functionality part, and focus what data was needed, either from the server or the user, and then focus on how that data needs to be manipulated before being sent back to the server, or sent further down the flow of the site.
