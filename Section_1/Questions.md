# Question 1

  These are the frameworks that I have worked with in my working history, listed in order of working experience
    1. Angular 8 and up
    2. Vue.js
    3. Angular JS

# Question 2

  The biggest difference in working with Vue compared to Angular, is the file structure. Where Angular has a folder that contains the files for a component, this folder holds the HTML, CSS (or SCSS), TypeScript and testing files.
  In Vue.js these files are all merge into one single file, with the HTML, TypeScript and CSS being written in sections below one another in the same file.
