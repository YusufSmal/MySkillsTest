# Question 1

  These are the frameworks that I have worked with in my working history, listed in order of working experiance
    1. Angular 8 and up
    2. Vue.js
    3. Angular JS

# Question 2

  The biggest differeance in working with Vue compared to Angular, is the file structure. Where Angular has a folder that contains the files for a component, this folder holds the HTML, CSS (or SCSS), TypeScript and testing files.
  In Vue.js these files are all merge into one single file, whith the HTML, TypeScript and CSS being writen in sections below one another in the same file.
