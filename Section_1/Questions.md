# Question 1

  These are the frameworks that I have worked with in my working history, listed in order of working experience
    1. Angular 8 and up
    2. Bootstrap
    3. Vue.js
    4. Angular JS

# Question 2

  The biggest difference in working with Vue compared to Angular, is the file structure. Where Angular has a folder that contains the files for a component, this folder holds the HTML, CSS (or SCSS), TypeScript and testing files.
  In Vue.js these files are all merge into one single file, with the HTML, TypeScript and CSS being written in sections below one another in the same file.

# Question 3

	There are 2 projects that come to mind, Uconomy and PMT

  In the Uconomy project, we were tasked with taking a standard website that was created without a framework, and only used basics of frontend coding, and recreated the site in Angular, while recreating the backend, and developing a mobile app at the same time. 
  In this process we looked at what the original site was doing, how it was handling data, and what data it was working with. Then we looked at what improvements are changes need to be implemented with in that process, then we started to recreate the application pages and functions as discussed. Once these pages were functional we would further discuss if the flow of the website was still working, if there were layout changes needed, or any further improvements that were discovered during the development process.

  In the PMT project, there was a much bigger focus on the rewrite of the existing site. This was due to the AngularJS code losing support in the coming months, as well as the site still being used in house at the time of development. The reason for the rewrite was for future clients that would get access to the site to manage their own service. As this was the situation, the upgrading of the site from AngularJS to Angular 14 would have been simpler.
  In the sections that I had worked on, I was given the API endpoints, and worked with the JSON data received from them to rebuild the pages in the original layout with updated code.
  Through this process I also questioned sections of the JSON response being received, as some of the data was not being used or formatted in an 'odd' way, that made the frontend code more complex than it had to be. Unfortunately the companies focus had been spread to many different things at once, and this lead to the frontend development mostly taking a back seat. I often didn't have the support from the backend devs that was required as they were trying to rebuild other old systems and create new systems required for security.
