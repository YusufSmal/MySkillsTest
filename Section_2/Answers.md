# Question 4

	I have had some YouTube experience of Python, working on a Raspberry Pi and Arduino. I have followed the code examples on a few videos to create LED NeoPixel strips work and display desired effects.
	A small project I was working on was using an arduino to create a device that controls an LED Strip, after prompting the user to connect the device to a WiFi signal by creating a Wifi access point on the arduino that allows the user to add the WiFi settings to the arduino.
	I have unfortunately not had any experience in implementing Python code in a backend system that communicates with a full frontend system.

# Question 5

	From my experience I can only follow the same principals that I use in frontend code to ensure scalability in a backend service.
	In this I would create small components of code, this way a section of code can be rewritten or update as the system grows, and can be reused by different sections of the system, to reduce code duplication.
