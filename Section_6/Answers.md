# Question 11

	In my Understanding of the 2 database management systems, SQL databases require a server to be setup and a database to be created on the server, then accessed through specific SQL management software, this database also needs to be managed carefully, as the wrong data format can cause a problem when logged.
	Where PostgreSQL is highly fault tolerant, and is capable of running on a wider variety of OSs. With PostgreSQL being open source, it is a more affordable choice in organizations, especially smaller companies.

# Question 12

	In my experience and knowledge of docker, I understand docker to allow a developer to create a section of a system, that can then be deployed on request to add or increase functionality to a system. Much like the use or functionality of creating reusable code, these containers of code and be added and removed from a system to increase the systems functions or performance. This understanding I have of containers comes from my understanding of AWS systems and their scalability, using nodes.
