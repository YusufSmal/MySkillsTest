# Question 7

	When I was working for PMT, we used Jira for all of the project tracking, as well as billing for the clients. Jira was linked to BitBucket, which allowed all the tickets to be linked to the repositories, and code changes.
	There was a bitBucket rule that made the code pushes follow the ticket numbering system, which ensured that every code push was linked to a ticket number, this way all the code liked to a ticket showed up on the ticket page in Jira. This allowed the teams to see what was worked on, when it was worked on, as well as open any repository where that work was done.
	I was fascinated by seeing how this system liked everything together.

# Question 8

	The use of BitBucket in a team can lend a hand to keeping code standards up to scratch, and making sure code is reviewed when it is merged into the main repository. As used in PMT, we used bitbucket to keep track of all the code work being done. This meant that every ticket being worked on will have a new branch for the work being done, once this work is done, the code is pushed and dev tested, then a pull request is created with the relevant co-workers added as reviewers. Once all the marked participants have approved the changes made, the code is merged into a higher branch, be that the main branch or a version branch.
