# Question 6

	While working for PMT, I was given the opportunity to work through an Angular Certification course. In this course there is an angular project that needs to be developed and submitted for review. This project was to create a countries multiple choice questioner.
	I was supplied with a document that listed all the third-party APIs for the different functions involved in the project outline.
	There were no complications that I had faced with this implementation, as the documentation was well written, and any questions I had around understanding the implementation, was answered by working through the documentation. This has been the most that I worked with third-party integrations and did not meet any big difficulties.

	Here is the link to that project, that is also on GitHub: https://github.com/YusufSmal/countries
